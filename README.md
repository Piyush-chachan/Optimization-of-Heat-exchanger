# Optimization-of-Heat-exchanger-using-ML-Algorithms
This project is targeted to understand and find out the affects features/factors on efficiency and pressure drop of Heat exchanger. Heat exchanger contains two fluids one with high temperature(hot fluid) and other with cold temperature(cold fluid). We generate data using c++ model, due to companies policy. 
Than conclude our observations using the model and create a ANN model which helps in further prediction of effectiveness and pressure drop.
